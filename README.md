# Beverage Nutritional Analysis

- Analyzed a beverage dataset to explore nutritional characteristics, using feature engineering and one-hot encoding for data preprocessing.
- Implemented dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and t-SNE) to visualize data patterns, highlighting differences between tea and non-tea drinks.
- Created visualizations and correlation analyses using Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn) to identify potential indicators for beverage categorization.
